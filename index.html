				Post One<br>
				<br>
				Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?<br>
				<br>
				The first week was much more about adapability and new information than I expected. I was both alittle concerened I hadn't properly looked at everything, or I had lost something in miscommunicaiton. But I enjoyed the challenge of working with my wits to get up to speed. <br>
				<br>
				What are you struggling with?<br>
				<br> 
				My biggest struggle right now is discipline and time management these first few weeks. Between continuing to try and become more of an adult than I already am, trying to be independant as I am, and being way to proud for my own good, a lot gets overlooked or forgotten until I just somehow remember. The one good thing going for me is I still likely finishing what I started, and I'm way to much of a perfectionist and idealist to not twiddle and tinker with things unless I'm content with them already.<br>
				What are you excited or eager to learn more about?<br>
				<br>
				I'm really excited to learn more about page responciveness with javascipt I believe. That and more ability to not just make one webpage but then start making an entire site to give go UX flow and experience, once we get to that point I'll be over the moon.<br>

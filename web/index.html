                    Post One<br>
                    <br>
                    Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?<br>
                    <br>
                    The first week was much more about adapability and new information than I expected. I was both alittle concerened I hadn't properly looked at everything, or I had lost something in miscommunicaiton. But I enjoyed the challenge of working with my wits to get up to speed. <br>
                    <br>
                    What are you struggling with?<br>
                    <br> 
                    My biggest struggle right now is discipline and time management these first few weeks. Between continuing to try and become more of an adult than I already am, trying to be independant as I am, and being way to proud for my own good, a lot gets overlooked or forgotten until I just somehow remember. The one good thing going for me is I still likely finishing what I started, and I'm way to much of a perfectionist and idealist to not twiddle and tinker with things unless I'm content with them already.<br>
                    <br>
                    What are you excited or eager to learn more about?<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm really excited to learn more about page responciveness with javascipt I believe. That and more ability to not just make one webpage but then start making an entire site to give go UX flow and experience, once we get to that point I'll be over the moon.<br>

                    What are your thoughts on Pseudo Coding?
                    <br>
                    Pseudocode was alot more intentsive than i knew of before I learned this week. There can be a great difference between Pseudocode and coding itself but nothings stopping you from getting from abstract thoughts to detailed nodes, methods, etc while Pseudocoding.
                    <br>
                    What are you struggling with?<br>
                    <br>
                    Putting my nose to the grindstone, there still a lot of periphery things going on, and I can't wait until we start meeting in person. Once I have a schedule and commit to the word i've given how I structure my days will be so much better.<br>
                    <br>
                    What are you excited or eager to learn more about?<br>
                    <br>
                    People have been taking about Grid and Flex and other CSS methodologies; with design not being my strong suit, learning about those is very interesting for me.<br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and Javascript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
                    <br>
                    I remember when HTML 5 just came out and flash games were being replaced by HTML 5 games; playing with lightsabers in psuedovr in chrome when Star Wars the Force Awakens came out. I never thought CSS and JavaScript were still so integral. I recall doing "/wave /color3 SELLING DBONES" in RuneScape, seeing CSS for myself and using it weekly in a sense. How much I was missing when HTML is the parchement we paint with CSS, which we adorn with javascript to make interactive<br>

                    bpost4<br>
                    <br>
                    What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in Prework?<br>
                    <br>
                    I enjoyed how prework was structured; it gave flexibility with keeping some rigidity, yet the problem was not getting that message sooner, either by own doing or by other missunderstandings. It was not what I was expected from the time's inquired about the bootcamp and duing the interviews but they challenged me and made me learn.<br>
                    <br>
                    What was helpful?<br>
                    <br>
                    The feeling of everyone learning together and struggling no matter how much we previously knew or not. i had been pretty hands off helping others but i turned that around once realizing we're all in the same boat and that's a great stress off my shoulders.<br>
                    <br>
                    What hindered your progress? How did you overcome challenges?<br>
                    <br>
                    What hindered me was the same that helped me overcome. Making mistakes with my actions and in the same leiu trying to live on my means makes this program an incredible situation. Not only because it's super stressful, but also because its amazingly miraculous. I questioned if it was worth it to give it a try, worrying I'd mess it up to. Yet I keep my word, to the best of my ability. My pride is both my strength and my hubris.<br>

                    What did you learn about that helped you understand more about Design?<br>
                    <br>
                    What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand Design better?<br>
                    <br>
                    What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?<br>
